#  GoGamify: Gamification Web Platform

This development of this project is currently in-progress.

A gamification web platform where teachers can easily transform their learning materials, exams, and resources into an interactive progressive web app with gamified elements. The resulting web app will allow students to engage in learning in a fun way---interactively tracking their learning journeys, completing reading tasks, answering quizzes, acquiring virtual skill trees, earning virtual achievements badges, and sharing their progress with fellow students.
